## We made a portofolio about Python and this week we're learning the following points:
1. Pandas 
* Object Series
* Display Index
* Loc and iloc
* Data Frame
* Trying to use Data Titanic.csv

2. Unittest
Unittest is a software testing process that ensures every unit/function of the program is tested.

3. Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
Matplotlib and Seaborn are Python libraries that are used for data visualization.They have inbuilt modules for plotting different graphs.While Matplotlib is used to embed graphs into applications.Seaborn is primarily used for statistical graphs.But when should we use either of the two ?Let's understand this with the help of a comparative analysis.Below are the comparison between Python's two well-known visualization packages Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Matplotlib
* It's used for basic graph plotting like line charts,bar graphs,etc
* It mainly works with datasets and arrays.
* Matplotlib acts productively with data arrays and frames.It regards the aces and figures as objects
* Matplotlib is more customizable and pairs well with Pandas and Numpy for Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Seaborn
* It's mainly used for statistics visualization and can perform complex visualizations with fewer commands.
* It works with entire datasets.
* Seaborn is considerably more organized and functional than Matplotlib and treats the entire dataset as a solitary unit.
* Seaborn has more inbuilt themes and is mainly used for statistical analysis.

5. Exam Preparation
